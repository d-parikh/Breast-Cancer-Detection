# Breast Cancer Detection

Breast cancer detection can be done with the help of modern machine learning algorithms.
In this, we focus on how to deal with imbalanced data that have missing values using resampling techniques to enhance the classification accuracy of detecting breast cancer.

In our work, two classifiers algorithms KNN an SVM applied breast cancer dataset. Results show that using the SVM algorithm gives better performance. 

In the future, the same experiments will apply to different classifiers and different datasets.
